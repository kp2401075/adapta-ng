# adapta-ng
adapta-gtk theme next generation

This repo is for recreating adapta experience again.

this will use plata(https://gitlab.com/tista500/plata-theme) as a base to recreate Adapta theme.

This may not be perfect. I am not good with Graphics or GTK themes. 

If you think something can be improved please do a Pull request I'll be happy to include the changes.

## Todo
- [ ] make changes to accent colors 
- [ ] make changes to makefile
- [ ] configure theme name in make file
